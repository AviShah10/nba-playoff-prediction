# NBA Playoff Prediction Algorithm (MIDTERM)


## Introduction/Background:

The NBA is the world’s most competitive professional basketball league and each of its 30 teams try to win the NBA championship every season. Our project goal is to create a model to accurately predict which NBA teams have the best chance to make the NBA playoffs and win the championship. Our team is looking to use machine learning to predict the end ranking of teams by the halfway point, and find common traits in success so that teams can know what to improve to make the playoffs, or what they need to do to remain in the playoff picture.
