# THIS FILE IS GOING TO CREATE THE CONFUSION MATRIX FOR VARIOUS MODELS.
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# We are going to create the confusion matrices for each model. Thus we are going to have 4 overall confusion matrices. 
# The way we are going to do this is we are going to make the confusion matrix for each model, for each year, for ewach conference, and then add them all together up. 
# This will give us the overall confusion matrix for that model.
