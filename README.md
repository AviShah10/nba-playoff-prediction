## Dataset

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball/discussion
This dataset has multiple different CSV’s for different basketball statistics. One of the CSV’s that we will use is the game.csv file which has information on all basketball games since 1946 and until January 2023. We will only need to use the last 23 years of data so we will delete the game data from 1946 to 1999. This dataset include statistics on W/L, MIN, PTS, FGM, FGA, FG%, 3PM, 3PA, 3P%, FTM , FTA, FT%, OREB, DREB, REB, AST, STL, BLK, TOV, PF, +/-, all of which can be used for our algorithms.
