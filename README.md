# NBA Playoff Prediction Algorithm (MIDTERM)


## Introduction/Background:

The NBA is the world’s most competitive professional basketball league and each of its 30 teams try to win the NBA championship every season. Our project goal is to create a model to accurately predict which NBA teams have the best chance to make the NBA playoffs and win the championship. Our team is looking to use machine learning to predict the end ranking of teams by the halfway point, and find common traits in success so that teams can know what to improve to make the playoffs, or what they need to do to remain in the playoff picture.

## Problem Definition :


## Data Collection:


## Methods:


## Results and Discussion:

REQUIREMENTS AS PER THE ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
We expect to see data pre-processing in your project such as feature selection (Forward or backward feature selection, dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, Lasso, LDA, .. ), taking care of missing features in your dataset, …
We expect to see at least one supervised or unsupervised method implemented and the results need to be studied in details. For example evaluating your predictive model performance using different metrics (take a look at ML Metrics)
You MUST include visualizations of your dataset (if possible) and your results. Visualizations include graphs, charts, tables. Code snippets do not count as visualizations. You can use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create your visualizations. We recommend using Plotly for interactive visualizations in Python as well as interactive visualizations on your website.
(PLEASE FILL THIS WITH NECESSARY FIGURES, ETC.)
